However, we wouldn\u2019t be Amager if we didn\u2019t dig a little deeper into the matter. It appears that the word \u201csigte\u201d \u2013 in English \u201cto aim\u201d - can be taken back to the Viking era, where a \u201cSigtebr\u00f8d\u201d would be baked very hard as a substitute for a traditional longbow in areas where wood was scarce or even absent. After the victorious battle the Viking could then toast their bread bow on a traditional Anglo Saxon toaster. Illustrations of this bread bow have been found in several places in Ireland and Scotland, but not until recently did the confused archaeologists realize, what exactly was going on. Several hundred years later, Danish settlers in Minnesota brought the old Viking bread with them, and it soon gained widespread popularity. Also the bakery girls of blonde, Danish descent selling the bread, became popular to an extreme degree, and local Minnesotans soon nicknamed them \u201csigte broads\u201d for their good looks. In some areas the baker even had to arm his sigte broads with a traditional Danish long knife to dishearten the most intrusive young, male bread costumers.
