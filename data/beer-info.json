The fascinated brewers: Sean Lawson and JC Tetreault.\n\nLupulin powder is essentially a super concentrated hop product made by flash freezing and then shattering intact hop flowers. In early November, the team experimented with different ways of utilizing the lupulin powder in both the whirlpool and during the dry hop, taking into account beer and wort temperatures, contact time, lupulin powder temperatures, and consistency of the powder.","ibu":"No IBU","id":1861776,"name":"Pow Pow","raters":"8,064 Ratings","rating":"(4.45)","style":"IPA - Imperial \/ Double"},{"abv":"5.5% ABV","brewery":"Telegraph Brewing Company","date":"Added 02\/07\/18","description":"","ibu":"No IBU","id":2503342,"name":"Experimental Hazy IPA: Citra","raters":"47 Ratings","rating":"(3.8)","style":"IPA - New England"},{"abv":"6.2% ABV","brewery":"WISEACRE Brewing Company","date":"Added 08\/27\/13","description":"Malted and flaked wheat are used to bring body to this classic ale.

It's a new year in brews. I've got a feeling it's going to be a good beer year.\n\nI started 2014 in San Diego with my friends at Stone Brewing Company. We're making a nationally-released beer for the spring. This is a collaboration between Stone, Keri Kelli and me - guitarist for Alice Cooper and beer connoisseur from LA.\n\nIt's a wild mixture on many levels. Keri and I are pretty far apart in our music worlds, but it makes for great \"mashup\" of hard rock and funk. The beer will definitely go to 11! With an ABV of 9.8% and coriander, elderberries it's as unusual as our musical backgrounds. Look for that at special events in April and everywhere soon after.\n\nMore immediately, I'm working with SKA Brewing Company for a one-off brew. This is for my upcoming 2014 BrewSki tour in Colorado. I'm excited to get out and play yet another fun weekend with music, brews, and snow. With \"Kyle's Manipulated Modus IPA,\" we added more hops (if you can believe that), an additional dry hop of Mandarina Bavaria and an orange peel in a whirlpool. I haven't tasted it yet, looking forward to the enhanced flavor profiles.\n\nThere are lots of new brews in the works for 2014. I'm getting ready to release a new solo disc in August and plan to have a beer come out with each single. I'm calling it \"Hop tracks.\" Stay tuned for more info on these brews.","ibu":"87 IBU","id":620987,"name":"Keri Kelli\/Kyle Hollingsworth\/Stone Collective Distortion IPA","raters":"27,391 Ratings","rating":"(3.88)","style":"IPA - Imperial \/ Double"},{"abv":"7.8% ABV","brewery":"Ancestry Brewing Company","date":"Added 06\/21\/17","description":"","ibu":"85 IBU","id":2154656,"name":"Hazy IPA","raters":"87 Ratings","rating":"(3.91)","style":"IPA - American"},{"abv":"6.6% ABV","brewery":"Ancestry Brewing Company","date":"Added 04\/29\/18","description":"","ibu":"No IBU","id":2625917,"name":"Aussie Hazy IPA","raters":"140 Ratings","rating":"(3.69)","style":"IPA - New England"},{"abv":"7% ABV","brewery":"Double Mountain Brewery & Taproom","date":"Added 08\/21\/10","description":"This big, glowing, powerful IPA is packed with assertive Northwest hops that are floral, citrusy and resinous.

Trillium main man Jean Claude Tetreault (JC) came across the name of an old Danish type of bread called \u201cSigtebr\u00f8d\u201d, and we decided to aim for a beer with mostly the same ingredients as in this old style of bread. However, we wouldn\u2019t be Amager if we didn\u2019t dig a little deeper into the matter. It appears that the word \u201csigte\u201d \u2013 in English \u201cto aim\u201d - can be taken back to the Viking era, where a \u201cSigtebr\u00f8d\u201d would be baked very hard as a substitute for a traditional longbow in areas where wood was scarce or even absent. After the victorious battle the Viking could then toast their bread bow on a traditional Anglo Saxon toaster. Illustrations of this bread bow have been found in several places in Ireland and Scotland, but not until recently did the confused archaeologists realize, what exactly was going on. Several hundred years later, Danish settlers in Minnesota brought the old Viking bread with them, and it soon gained widespread popularity. Also the bakery girls of blonde, Danish descent selling the bread, became popular to an extreme degree, and local Minnesotans soon nicknamed them \u201csigte broads\u201d for their good looks. In some areas the baker even had to arm his sigte broads with a traditional Danish long knife to dishearten the most intrusive young, male bread costumers. All very weird, but indeed very true.","ibu":"No IBU","id":2135343,"name":"SigteBroad","raters":"8,746 Ratings","rating":"(3.76)","style":"IPA - American"},{"abv":"7.8% ABV","brewery":"Private Landbrauerei Sch\u00f6nram","date":"Added 04\/25\/15","description":"This beer has been reformulated from 2015, using only German hops.
